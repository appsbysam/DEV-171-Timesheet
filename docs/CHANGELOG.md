# 171 Café Staff Timesheet

## Version 3.1.0
Released: 4 August 2026

### Added
- Added a one-time first-name prompt on each phone.
- Checks the entered name case-insensitively against all staff records, including active and inactive staff.
- Stores the official staff ID and database spelling locally after a successful match.
- Active users continue into the timesheet.
- Inactive users are remembered and shown a **Check Again** screen until a manager activates them.
- Generates and stores an anonymous device ID silently.
- Detects and stores a simple device type such as **Android phone** or **iPhone**.
- Repeats the identification process if the stored staff identity is missing or invalid.

### Foundation
- Establishes the user and device identity required for the upcoming audit log.
- This release does not yet create or write to an audit table.

## Version 3.0.8
Released: 4 August 2026

### Changed

- The app checks for updates once at startup rather than every 10 minutes.
- If unsaved timesheet changes exist, they are saved before updating.
- Main local app files now receive a unique cache token on every load.
- Clicking **OK** reloads using a unique hard-refresh URL to retrieve the latest deployed files.

## Version 3.0.7
Released: 4 August 2026

### Added
- Added a clear **Update Available** dialog instead of an easily missed automatic reload notice.
- Added **Update Now** and **Later** options.
- Added **Save & Update** when unsaved timesheet changes exist.
- Added an automatic update check every 10 minutes while the app remains open.
- Choosing **Later** suppresses the prompt for the remainder of that browser session and allows it to appear again next time the app opens.

### Changed
- The app no longer forces an immediate update after briefly displaying a message.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` remains the single master changelog.
